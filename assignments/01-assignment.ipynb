Images, for example, are broken down to pixels and the colors in each pixels are represented as numbers (hexadecimal or RGB) that represents color intensities. Abstraction allows images to be stored more efficiently in compressed forms (as it is a list of numbers). This generalization also allows machines to better predict the most relevant patterns by analyzing how many pixels should the same colors be repeated and how each pixels should be arranged for it to be classified as an object in question.**"
